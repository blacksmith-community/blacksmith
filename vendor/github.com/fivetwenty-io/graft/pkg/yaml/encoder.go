// Encoder writes a stream of YAML documents to an io.Writer. Each call
// to Encode produces the same bytes as MarshalWith for that value, and
// documents after the first are preceded by a "---" separator line. An
// Encoder is not safe for concurrent use.
//
// When the writer fails, Encode returns its error, and whatever part of
// the document the writer took stays in the stream. A later Encode still
// writes its document right after that partial text, with a separator
// line only when an earlier document was written in full, so the stream
// no longer reads as the documents we encoded. As with encoding/json, we
// should stop using an Encoder after a write fails.
