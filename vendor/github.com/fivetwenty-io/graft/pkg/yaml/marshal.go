// Marshal encodes v as YAML, with every map's keys in spruce's order and
// two spaces of indentation, as graft merge writes a document.
//
// Marshal first walks v into plain maps, lists, and scalars, and graft's
// own encoder writes those, so a struct, a typed map, and a typed slice
// come out in the same style as a map[string]any does. The walk follows
// the yaml tag options a field names, which are a rename, "-",
// ,omitempty, ,inline, and ,flow, and a field with no yaml tag takes its
// key from its json tag and then from its name in lower case. Struct
// fields keep their declared order, and a type's own MarshalYAML method
// or MarshalText method supplies its value. A ,flow field is written on
// one line, with a string plain only when that is safe there and in
// double quotes otherwise.
//
// A string is written in the style spruce picks for it, so one that would
// read back as another type is quoted and a multi-line one is a literal
// block, even when it starts with an indicator such as "-", as a PEM
// certificate does. A multi-line string that a block cannot hold, such as
// one with a space at the end of a line or a U+2028 at the start of one,
// is double-quoted instead. A single-line string that starts with "-",
// "?", or ":" and a character other than a space, such as "-a", is
// double-quoted, and one with a space or nothing after the indicator, such
// as "- a" or "-", is single-quoted. A string that a YAML 1.1 reader
// resolves as a timestamp, such as 2026-01-02, is double-quoted. A key
// that spruce would write as a "? key" is double-quoted on one line
// instead, because goccy's parser misreads some of those, and so are
// strings that goccy's parser misreads in other places. A key whose
// double-quoted form would be longer than 1024 bytes still takes the
// "? key" form. A float that holds a whole
// number is plain integer digits when it fits in an int64, so 3.0 is 3
// and 1e6 is 1000000. A whole float outside that range, and any other
// float, has a "." (1e20 is 1.0e+20) so that a YAML 1.1 reader reads it
// as a float, and NaN and the infinities are .nan, .inf, and -.inf. A
// map key that is an integer, a bool, or a float is written as that
// scalar without quotes, and keys are ordered by the key order applied
// to their text, so 9 comes before 10 in spruce order.
//
// Unmarshal reads this output back to an equal value, with a whole float
// inside the int64 range coming back as an int when the target is any.
//
// Marshal refuses a v that holds a Node anywhere, including as a map key,
// because writing a Node tree back is not supported, a v that holds a
// cycle, a map key that is a collection, and a type whose MarshalYAML
// method returns YAML text. Its errors name a Go type and a field path
// and never quote a value from v. A value the encoder cannot write, such
// as a channel, is an error and not a panic, but a panic from a type's
// own MarshalYAML method is not recovered.
